## Project Abstract
**Introduction:** Clinically, breast cancer is divided into subgroups based on the assessment of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. HER2-/ER+ tumors constitute the luminal subgroup. By using a PAM50-based gene expression profiling assay, luminal tumors can be stratified into the intrinsic molecular subtypes Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2-enriched (HER2E). Despite its association with poor patient outcome, the luminal HER2E subtype currently holds no implications for clinical treatment decisions other than as a marker for aggressive disease due to a lack of insight into its characterizing features. Therefore, the study at hand aimed to comprehensively characterize luminal HER2E breast cancer based on clinicopathological and molecular features to evaluate the response of patients to conventionally administered therapies and identify features that might be used to inform treatment decisions in the future. 

**Methods:** The analyses in this study were based on the primary breast cancer datasets of two large independent cohorts. The Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network â€“ Breast study provided data on 4413 clinically ER+/HER2- cases (Luminal HER2E: 79; Luminal A: 2856; Luminal B: 1249). The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) provided data on 1227 clinically HER2-/ER+ cases (LumHER2E: 58; LumA: 622; LumB: 350). Approaches included comparative statistics of clinicopathological variables, survival analyses, gene expression analyses, mutational enrichment analyses, and copy number analyses.

**Results:** The findings of the study at hand demonstrated that luminal HER2E breast cancer is a small but clinically important subgroup that is associated with a significantly faster disease recurrence than other luminal subtypes, regardless of current standard of care treatment. With highly proliferative characteristics akin to the Luminal B subtype, HER2E tumors are characterized by a low expression of ESR1, a high immune response, a high burden of copy number alterations and a high frequency of TP53 mutations.
